						Sounds go in, sounds go out, you can't explain it. Maybe i can try...
						I can remember when i turned 9. Because my life celebration anniversary was also on the 9th. My mom hid my gifts around
						the living room. The only ones i remember getting were two or three Beatles cassette tapes (pre Rubber Soul). I listened
						to them a shit ton, and brought them into school and made everyone listen whenever i got the chance. When i was the only
						one home, I would play some of my moms records/tapes. I'd blast Bruce Springsteen and turn off the lights and dance to
						"dancing in the dark". My mothers music choices (most of them, never could get into U2) were the first waves of sonic 
						awesomeness to be stored in my brain.</p>

				<article class="bio-article2">
					<p class="bio-par2">	Then I started seeing the modern rock music of MTV (Alice n Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam). And one day on the
						bus, my childhood best friend's older brother Neal told me about the local modern rock station. From that point forward 
						i was hooked on the heavy guitar tones and riffs. Eventually i got heavier and heavier, went through a Metallica phase,
						went through a RATM phase.</p>

				<article class="bio-article3">
					<p class="bio-par3">	All of this music i consumed before I ever started to play. I first started to play bass and drums when i was around 20-21.
						It was only a matter of time before my fingers/hands could do what my brain wanted them to do. And in my brain was all of 
						this music i had been listening to (countless hours). They are just memories, some memories are stronger and last longer, 
						but they are all still there. And what comes out musically on my end is just a big ole jumble of all of those memories.
						Sounds go in, sounds go out...</p>
